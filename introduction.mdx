description: 'Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)'
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.

## Why MCP

MCP is a great choice for anyone building agents or complex integrations on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into.
  - Check out our official [servers repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for a focused list and [MCP Get](https://mcp-get.com/) for a more complete directory
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a client application can connect to multiple servers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Client["MCP Client\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
        S1["MCP Server A"]
        S2["MCP Server B"]
        S3["MCP Server C"]

        Client <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
        Client <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
        Client <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3

        S1 <--> R1[("Local\nResource A")]
        S2 <--> R2[("Local\nResource B")]
    end

    subgraph "Internet"
        S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| R3[("Remote\nResource C")]
    end
```

- **MCP Client**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access resources through MCP
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Resources**: Your computer's resources (databases, files, services) that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Resources**: Resources available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to
