title: "Connecting MCP to Claude"
description: "Get started with MCP in less than 5 minutes"
---

Give Claude superpowers by connecting it to your local computer! This guide will show you how to set up Model Context Protocol (MCP) and experience its magic in just 5 minutes.

<Note>
MCP connects Claude to external data sources and tools. In this guide, we'll give Claude the ability to:
- Take screenshots and analyze them
- Control window arrangement
- Execute local automation scripts

And it does this all securely - Claude can only access what you explicitly allow through MCP servers.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Windows/Linux guides coming soon)
- Node.js v16 or higher (`node --version` to check)
- Git (`git --version` to check)
- [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) installed

<Accordion title="Need to install the prerequisites?">
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install node git

# Or download directly:
# Node.js: https://nodejs.org
# Git: https://git-scm.com
```
</Accordion>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install example servers">
    Let's start by getting some pre-built MCP servers that Claude can use:

    ```bash
    # Clone the example servers
    git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/example-servers
    cd example-servers
    
    # Install dependencies and build
    npm install
    npm run build
    
    # Make servers available globally
    npm install -g
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Claude">
    Open your Claude Desktop App configuration:

    ```bash
    code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    Add this configuration (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "osascript": {
          "command": "mcp-server-osascript",
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Save and **restart Claude Desktop App**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test it out

Let's verify everything is working with a simple example. Try sending this prompt to Claude:

```
Can you take a screenshot of my desktop and describe what you see?
```

Claude will:

1. Request permission to take a screenshot
2. Capture your screen through the MCP server
3. Analyze and describe the screenshot

<Frame>
  <img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="Example Claude conversation showing a screenshot analysis" />
</Frame>
<Note>
The first time you use screenshot features, macOS will ask for permissions:
- Screen Recording (for screenshots)
- Automation (for window control)
You'll need to grant these to Claude.app in System Settings.
</Note>

## Try these examples

Now that MCP is working, try these increasingly powerful examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Window Analysis" active>
    ```
    Could you analyze my open windows and tell me:
    - How many windows I have open
    - Which apps are running
    - If any windows look cluttered
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Window Organization">
    ```
    Could you help organize my windows? I'd like:
    - Browser on the left half
    - VSCode on the right half
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create a Window Layout Script">
    ```
    I often need this window layout for coding:
    - VSCode taking up the left 60%
    - Terminal in the top right
    - Browser in the bottom right
    Could you create an AppleScript to automate this?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What just happened?

Let's break down the magic:

1. When you installed the `osascript` server, you gave Claude a way to:
   - Take screenshots (see what you see)
   - Run AppleScript (control your windows)
   - Automate macOS tasks

2. The MCP protocol lets Claude:
   - Request these actions securely
   - Get results back in real-time
   - Chain actions together intelligently

3. All of this happens locally on your machine - no data leaves your computer!

## Add more capabilities

Want to give Claude even more superpowers? Add these servers to your configuration:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File System Access" icon="folder-open">
    Add this to your config to let Claude read and analyze files:
    ```json
    "tee": {
      "command": "mcp-server-tee",
      "args": ["tail", "-f", "/var/log/system.log"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database Connection" icon="database">
    Connect Claude to your PostgreSQL database:
    ```json
    "postgres": {
      "command": "mcp-server-postgres",
      "args": ["postgresql://localhost/mydb"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Web Automation" icon="globe">
    Enable web automation capabilities:
    ```json
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "mcp-server-puppeteer",
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nothing showing up in Claude?">
    1. Check if MCP is enabled:
       - Click the ðŸ”Œ icon in Claude
       - You should see your configured servers
    
    2. Verify your config:
       ```bash
       cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
       ```
    
    3. Restart Claude completely:
       - Quit the app (not just close the window)
       - Start it again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission errors?">
    Run this command to see Claude's logs:
    ```bash
    tail -f ~/Claude.log
    ```
    
    Common fixes:
    - Check `HOME` env variable in your config
    - Grant missing permissions in System Settings
    - Try running example commands manually in Terminal
