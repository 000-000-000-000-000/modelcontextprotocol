Give the Claude Desktop app the ability to interact with local data sources and tools! This guide will show you how to set up Model Context Protocol (MCP) and experience its capabilities in just 5 minutes.

<Note>
While this guide focuses on using Claude Desktop as an example MCP client, the protocol is open and can be implemented by any application. IDEs, AI tools, and other software can all act as MCP clients to access local services in a standardized way.
</Note>

<Warning>
Claude Desktop's MCP support is currently in developer preview and only supports connecting to local servers running on your machine. Remote connections are not yet supported. MCP integration is only available in the Claude Desktop app, not the Claude web interface (claude.ai).
</Warning>

MCP is a protocol that enables secure connections between clients, such as Claude Desktop app, and local services. In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a local SQLite database
- Connect Claude Desktop to it through MCP
- Query and analyze your data securely

## How MCP Works

MCP is an open protocol that enables secure, controlled interactions between any compatible client application (like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or other AI tools) and local services:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Client["MCP Client\n(e.g. Claude Desktop)"]
        MCP[MCP Server]
        DB[(SQLite DB)]
        
        Client <-->|MCP Protocol| MCP
        MCP <-->|Local Access| DB
    end
```

1. **MCP Servers**: Small programs that expose specific capabilities (like database access) through a standardized interface
2. **Protocol**: An open standard that allows any MCP client to:
   - Discover available capabilities
   - Request actions securely
   - Receive results and updates
3. **Local Only**: All communication happens entirely on your machine - no data leaves your computer

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Windows/Linux guides coming soon)
- Node.js v18 or higher (`node --version` to check)
- Git (`git --version` to check)
- [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- SQLite (`sqlite3 --version` to check)

<Accordion title="Need to install the prerequisites?">
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install node git sqlite3

# Or download directly:
# Node.js: https://nodejs.org
# Git: https://git-scm.com
# SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
```
</Accordion>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install example servers">
    Let's start by getting the pre-built MCP servers:

    ```bash
    # Clone the example servers
    git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/example-servers
    cd example-servers
    
    # Install dependencies and build
    npm install
    npm run build
    
    # Make servers available globally
    npm install -g
    ```

    This makes the MCP servers available as command-line tools that Claude Desktop can launch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a sample database">
    Let's create a simple SQLite database for testing:

    ```bash
    # Create a new SQLite database
    sqlite3 ~/test.db <<EOF
    CREATE TABLE products (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT,
      price REAL
    );
    
    INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
      ('Widget', 19.99),
      ('Gadget', 29.99),
      ('Gizmo', 39.99);
    EOF
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
    Open your Claude Desktop App configuration:

    ```bash
    code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    Add this configuration (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sqlite": {
          "command": "mcp-server-sqlite",
          "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/test.db"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This tells Claude Desktop:
    1. There's an MCP server named "sqlite"
    2. Launch it using the `mcp-server-sqlite` command
    3. Connect it to your test database
    4. Provide necessary environment variables

    Save and **restart Claude Desktop App**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test it out

Let's verify everything is working. Try sending this prompt to Claude Desktop:

```
Can you connect to my SQLite database and tell me what products are available and their prices?
```

Claude Desktop will:
1. Connect to the SQLite MCP server
2. Query your local database
3. Format and present the results

</Frame>

## What's happening under the hood?

When you interact with Claude Desktop using MCP:

1. **Server Discovery**: Claude Desktop loads your configured MCP servers on startup
2. **Protocol Handshake**: When you ask about data, Claude Desktop:
   - Identifies which MCP server can help (sqlite in this case)
   - Negotiates capabilities through the MCP protocol
   - Establishes a secure local connection

3. **Interaction Flow**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant C as Claude Desktop
       participant M as MCP Server
       participant D as SQLite DB
       
       C->>M: Initialize connection
       M-->>C: Available capabilities
       
       C->>M: Query request
       M->>D: SQL query
       D-->>M: Results
       M-->>C: Formatted results
   ```

4. **Security**: 
   - MCP servers only expose specific, controlled capabilities
   - All communication is local to your machine
   - Claude Desktop requires user confirmation for sensitive operations

## Try these examples

Now that MCP is working, try these increasingly powerful examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Queries" active>
    ```
    What's the average price of all products in the database?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Analysis">
    ```
    Can you analyze the price distribution and suggest any pricing optimizations?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complex Operations">
    ```
    Could you help me design and create a new table for storing customer orders?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Add more capabilities

Want to give Claude Desktop more local integration capabilities? Add these servers to your configuration:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File System Access" icon="folder-open">
    Add this to your config to let Claude Desktop read and analyze files:
    ```json
    "tee": {
      "command": "mcp-server-tee",
      "args": ["tail", "-f", "/var/log/system.log"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PostgreSQL Connection" icon="database">
    Connect Claude Desktop to your PostgreSQL database:
    ```json
    "postgres": {
      "command": "mcp-server-postgres",
      "args": ["postgresql://localhost/mydb"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nothing showing up in Claude Desktop?">
    1. Check if MCP is enabled:
       - Click the ðŸ”Œ icon in Claude Desktop
       - You should see your configured servers
    
    2. Verify your config:
       ```bash
       cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
       ```
    
    3. Restart Claude Desktop completely:
       - Quit the app (not just close the window)
       - Start it again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database connection errors?">
    1. Check Claude Desktop's logs:
       ```bash
       tail -f ~/Claude.log
       ```
    
    2. Verify database access:
       ```bash
       # Test database connection
       sqlite3 ~/test.db ".tables"
       ```
       
    3. Common fixes:
       - Check file paths in your config
       - Verify database file permissions
       - Ensure SQLite is installed properly
