title: "Elicitation"
description: "Let your servers request additional information from users"
---

Elicitation is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request additional information directly from users through the client, enabling interactive workflows while maintaining security and privacy controls.

<Info>
  This feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.

## How elicitation works

The elicitation flow follows these steps:

1. Server sends an `elicitation/create` request to the client
2. Client presents the request to the user
3. User provides the requested information
4. Client reviews and can modify the response
5. Client returns the result to the server

This human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what information they share with servers.

## Message format

Elicitation requests use a standardized message format:

```typescript
{
  message: string
}
```

The response format is:

```typescript
{
  content: [
    {
      type: "text" | "image" | "audio",
      
      // For text:
      text?: string,
      
      // For images:
      data?: string,             // base64 encoded
      mimeType?: string,
      
      // For audio:
      data?: string,             // base64 encoded
      mimeType?: string
    },
    // Additional content items...
  ],
  cancelled?: boolean
}
```

## Request parameters

### Message

The `message` field contains the text prompt to present to the user, explaining what information is being requested and why.

## Response format

The client returns an elicitation result with:

- `content`: An array of the user's responses, which can include:
  - Text content with a `text` field
  - Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields
  - Audio content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields
- `cancelled`: Optional boolean indicating if the user cancelled the request

The content array allows clients to return multiple response items of different types, such as text with an accompanying image.

## Example requests

### Basic elicitation

```json
{
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "message": "What is your favorite programming language?"
  }
}
```

### Example response with multiple content items

```json
{
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Python"
      },
      {
        "type": "image",
        "data": "base64-encoded-image-data",
        "mimeType": "image/png"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best practices

When implementing elicitation:

1. Provide clear, concise messages explaining what information is needed and why
2. Only request information that is necessary for the task
3. Handle all response types appropriately (text, image, audio)
4. Respect user privacy and data minimization principles
5. Consider returning multiple content items when appropriate
7. Validate responses before using them
8. Handle cancellations gracefully
9. Consider progressive disclosure for complex information requests
10. Document expected elicitation behavior

## Human in the loop controls

Elicitation is designed with user agency in mind:

### For requests

- Clients should clearly show which server is requesting information
- Users should be able to modify or reject requests
- Clients can filter or block inappropriate requests
- Users should understand why the information is being requested

### For responses

- Users should be able to review their responses before sending
- Clients should provide clear UI for structured data input
- Users should be able to cancel requests at any time
- Clients can sanitize or modify responses to protect privacy

## Security considerations

When implementing elicitation:

- Validate all message content
- Sanitize sensitive information
- Implement appropriate rate limits
- Monitor elicitation usage
- Encrypt data in transit
- Handle user data privacy
- Audit elicitation requests
- Implement timeouts
- Provide clear privacy policies
- Allow users to opt out

## Common patterns

### Interactive workflows

Elicitation enables interactive patterns like:

- Progressive form filling
- Multi-step data collection
- Contextual information gathering
- Clarification of ambiguous requests
- Confirmation of critical actions

### Multiple content items

Best practices for handling multiple content items:

- Consider when multiple items enhance the response
- Organize content items in a logical order
- Handle cases where clients may only support a subset of content types
- Validate each content item individually

### Error handling

Robust error handling should:

- Catch validation failures
- Handle timeout errors
- Manage rate limits
- Provide helpful error messages
- Support retries when appropriate
- Log errors appropriately

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

- Elicitation depends on client capabilities
- Not all clients support multiple content items
- Users control what information they provide
- Response formats may be limited
- Rate limits may apply
- User experience varies by client
- Response times depend on user interaction
- Not all content types may be supported by all clients
