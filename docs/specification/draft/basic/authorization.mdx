<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol provides authorization capabilities at the transport level,
enabling MCP clients to make requests to restricted MCP servers on behalf of resource
owners. This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.

### 1.2 Protocol Requirements

Authorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:

- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.
- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and
  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.
- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best
  practices for their protocol.

### 1.3 Standards Compliance

This authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but
implements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability
while maintaining simplicity:

- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12))
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))
- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13))

## 2. Authorization Flow

### 2.1 Overview

1. MCP authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security
   measures for both confidential and public clients.

1. MCP authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).

1. MCP servers **MUST** implement [OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13).
   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization discovery.

1. MCP authorization servers and MCP clients **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)).

### 2.1.1 OAuth Grant Types

OAuth specifies different flows or grant types, which are different ways of obtaining an
access token. Each of these targets different use cases and scenarios.

MCP servers **SHOULD** support the OAuth grant types that best align with the intended
audience. For instance:

1. Authorization Code: useful when the client is acting on behalf of a (human) end user.
   - For instance, an agent calls an MCP tool implemented by a SaaS system.
2. Client Credentials: the client is another application (not a human)
   - For instance, an agent calls a secure MCP tool to check inventory at a specific
     store. No need to impersonate the end user.

### 2.2 Roles
A protected MCP server acts as a [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12.html#name-roles),
capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

An MCP client acts a [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12.html#name-roles),
making protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.

The authorization server is responsible for interacting with the user and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server. The implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be the same server as the
resource server or a separate entity. Section [2.3 Authorization Server Discovery](#2-3-authorizaton-server-discovery)
specifies how an MCP server indicates the location of an authorization server to a client.

### 2.3 Authorization Server Discovery
This section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated
authorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP
clients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.

### 2.3.1 Authorization Server Location
MCP servers **MUST** implement the [OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13)
specification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include
the `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.

The specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult
the [OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13) documentation for
guidance on implementation details.

MCP servers **MUST** use the HTTP header `WWW-Authenticate` when returning a _401 Unauthorized_ to indicate the location of the resource server metadata URL
as described in [OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-13).

MCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.


#### 2.3.2 Server Metadata Discovery

MCP clients **MUST** follow the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata protocol defined
in [RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) to obtain the information
required to interact with the authorization server.

#### 2.3.3 MCP specific headers for discovery

MCP clients **SHOULD** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version: <protocol-version>` HTTP header during
Server Metadata Discovery to allow the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol
version.

MCP servers **SHOULD** use the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header to determine compatibility with the MCP client.

For example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2024-11-05`

#### 2.3.4 Sequence Diagram
The following diagram outlines an example flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP Request without token
    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata<br />from WWW-Authenticate

    C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
    M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL
    Note over C: Validate RS Metadata,<br />build AS metadata URL

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata

    Note over C,A: OAuth 2.1 authorization flow happens here

    C->>A: Token Request
    A-->>C: Access Token

    C->>M: MCP Request with Access Token
    M-->>C: Protected Resource Response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

### 2.4 Dynamic Client Registration

MCP clients and servers **SHOULD** support the
[OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)
to allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction. This provides a
standardized way for clients to automatically register with new servers, which is crucial
for MCP because:

- Clients cannot know all possible servers in advance
- Manual registration would create friction for users
- It enables seamless connection to new servers
- Servers can implement their own registration policies

Any MCP servers that _do not_ support Dynamic Client Registration need to provide
alternative ways to obtain a client ID (and, if applicable, client secret). For one of
these servers, MCP clients will have to either:

1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client secret) specifically for that MCP
   server, or
2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an
   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the
   server).

### 2.5 Authorization Flow Steps

The complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP Request without token
    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata from WWW-Authenticate

    alt WWW-Authenticate header not present
        C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
        M->>C: Resource metadata with authorization_server URL
    end

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A->>C: Authorization server metadata

    alt Dynamic Client Registration
        C->>A: POST /register
        A->>C: Client Credentials
    end

    Note over C: Generate PKCE Parameters
    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge
    B->>A: Authorization Request
    Note over A: User authorizes
    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code
    B->>C: Authorization code callback
    C->>A: Token Request + code_verifier
    A->>C: Access Token (+ Refresh Token)
    C->>M: MCP Request with Access Token
    M->>C: Protected Resource Response
```

### 2.6 Access Token Usage

#### 2.6.1 Token Requirements

Access token handling **MUST** conform to
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5)
requirements for resource requests. Specifically:

1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field
   [Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.1.1):

```
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Note that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,
even if they are part of the same logical session.

2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string

Example request:

```http
GET /v1/contexts HTTP/1.1
Host: mcp.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

#### 2.6.2 Token Handling

Resource servers **MUST** validate access tokens as described in
[Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.2).
If validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to
[Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.3)
error handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401
response.

MCP client **MUST NOT** send tokens other than issued by the MCP authorization server.

MCP servers **MUST** only issue tokens that are valid for use with their own resources.
MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.

### 2.8 Error Handling

Servers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:

| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |
| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |
| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |


## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Client Token Theft
Attackers who obtain tokens stored by the client can access protected resources with
requests that appear legitimate to resource servers.

Clients **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth 2.0 best practices,
as outlined in [RFC 9700](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700).

### 3.2 Server Token Theft
An attacker who compromises an MCP authorization server may access stored tokens. MCP authorization servers SHOULD enforce token expiration and rotation to limit the window of exploitation.

### 3.3 Token Interception
An attacker positioned between clients and servers can intercept tokens transmitted over insecure connections. All authorization endpoints MUST be served over HTTPS. Clients MUST implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 section 7.5.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12.html#name-countermeasures)

### 3.4 Open Redirection
An attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites. MCP authorization servers MUST validate redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.

###  3.5 Insecure Redirect URIs
An attacker can capture data transmitted to non-secure endpoints. Redirect URIs MUST be either localhost URLs or HTTPS URLs to prevent token and code interception.

### 3.6 Confused Deputy Problem
An attacker can exploit OAuth proxy configurations that share 3rd party client credentials across multiple users. When an MCP server fronts another authorization server that does not support dynamic client registration, the MCP uses a static client_id with the backing service. If the backing service sets cookies after user authorization, an attacker can craft malicious authorization requests that bypass consent screens for previously authorized applications. MCP servers using a static client_id for a backing service MUST require explicit approval for each newly registered dynamic client prior to forwarding requests to the backing authorization server for user consent.
