protocol is versioned.

Revisions may be marked as:

- **Draft**: in-progress specifications, not yet ready for consumption.
- **Current**: the current protocol version, which is ready for use and may continue to
  receive [backwards compatible changes]({{< ref "../basic/versioning" >}}).
- **Final**: past, complete specifications that will not be changed.
